    "NAME": "Ransacked Forge",
    "DESCRIPTIONS": [
      "While wandering the Spire, you find a Forge, presumably ~ransacked~ by #rmonsters. While they did an adequate job of raiding the place, you notice there are still some things here that can be of use to you. NL NL A #rdying #rfire ~sputters~ across the room, though you wonder what else you can find...",
      "Harnessing the #rintense #rheat of the fire, you make your burning blade even...burn-ier. Neat!",
      "You manage to find a gremlin-sized #ypotion #ybelt! It's a bit too small for your liking, but you manage to fit one potion in there; one you found lying under a dusty cabinet. Gross.",
      "Meh. Loot is for nerds anyway.",
      "You haphazardly insert all of your outdated #yStrikes into the fire. NL NL They suck up the flames like a young #pGremlin #pWizard's brain sucks up wizardry lessons, and before you know it, the fire is ~extinguished~ and you are left with a #rsearing arsenal.",
      "You spy with your little spire-slaying eye a #yblade stuck in the fire! NL NL Quickly grabbing it, you take it out of the mini inferno and add it to your collection as you cry just a little bit from the pain of the flames."
